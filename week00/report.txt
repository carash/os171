Week0's task was to register one's self to the badak.cs.ui.ac.id system

In order for one to be able to complete this task, three accounts are needed, two of which can be created by the users themselves. The three accounts are a google account, a github account, and an SSO account.

After acquiring the three accounts, the user is to fill out a google form containing the user's basic information. Once the form is filled out, the user must then create a GitHub repository for working on weekly tasks.

After at most 24 hours, the accounts and information will be confirmed and the users can check their validity so they can fix any istakes made.

After they have been validated, the user should then check if they are registered to the Badak system by loggin in through PuTTY.
